# Affiliate-Bot
The AI bot, built using the Google Gemini API, is designed to assist with affiliate marketing. It processes a list of products, analyzes trends, market data, and other key factors, and then recommends the most profitable products to promote for optimal returns.


This code represents a sophisticated affiliate marketing analysis tool that leverages Google's advanced Gemini 1.5 Flash AI model and Python language to provide data-driven product recommendations. The program intelligently processes lists of products and analyzes them through multiple critical business metrics: current market trends, commission structures, product popularity, price points, and potential Return on Investment (ROI). What makes this tool particularly valuable for affiliate marketers is its ability to look beyond simple commission rates â€“ it considers the complete market context to identify products with the highest profit potential. The AI model's analysis is comprehensive, providing not just recommendations but also detailed justifications for each suggested product, helping marketers make informed decisions. By using the Gemini 1.5 Flash model, which is trained on vast amounts of current market data, the tool can identify emerging trends and opportunities that might be missed in manual analysis. This automated approach can save marketers hours of research time while potentially increasing their success rate by focusing their efforts on products with the highest likelihood of generating sustainable income through affiliate marketing.

To properly run the bot, make sure to install packages in your terminal which are listed in the comments in the top of the affBOT.py file.
Obtain a [Google Gemini API KEY](https://ai.google.dev/gemini-api/docs?_gl=1*1ydct19*_ga*MTczMDYzNTE2OS4xNzM1MzQyMjkz*_ga_P1DBVKWT6V*MTczNTM1NjI4MS4yLjEuMTczNTM1NjI4NS41Ni4wLjEyNjc1MTcwNQ..) and insert in the place where it shows "INSERT API KEY HERE" in the affBOT.py file.

In the terminal, when a program executes, feed it the data (product names, a little description, and commission rates if possible). Give it 5-10 sec to analyze, and receive calculated response.
